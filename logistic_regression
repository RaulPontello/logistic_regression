# Input

data = pd.read_csv('SAT.csv', sep = ',')
x = data[['SAT']]
y = data['Admitted']
train_size = 0.7 # how much data from x will x_train have 

# Define train and test data

x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, train_size=train_size, random_state=2811)

# Output

# Create Logistic Regression

logistic_regression = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', random_state=0)

# Perform logistic regression

logistic_regression.fit(x_train, y_train) 

# Model coefficients

b0 = logistic_regression.intercept_

# Make predictions for y

y_prediction = logistic_regression.predict(x_test)

# Model metrics

model_score = logistic_regression.score(x_test, y_test)

# Results

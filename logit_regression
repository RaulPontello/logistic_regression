# Input

data = pd.read_csv('data.csv', sep = ',')
x = data[['SAT']]
y = data['Admitted']
train_size = 0.7 # how much data from x will x_train have 

# Define train and test data

# Output

# Create Logistic Regression

# Perform logistic regression

logistic_regression.fit(x_train, y_train) 

# Model coefficients

# Make predictions for y

y_prediction = logistic_regression.predict(x_test)

# Model metrics

# Results
